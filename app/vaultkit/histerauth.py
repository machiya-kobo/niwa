"""Hister's users as the one sign-in (AUTH=hister), for any room: the room's side of the hister-login helper.

A room in `<P>_AUTH=hister` mode never talks to Hister about people. It asks the helper (stack/hister-login), over the
internal network, whether a credential is good:

    GET {<P>_AUTH_URL}/v1/check   X-Machiya-Session: mhs_…   (the machiya_sso cookie, or Bearer mhs_… from an app)
                                  X-Access-Token: <t>         (a Hister token: X-Access-Token, or any other Bearer)

and caches the answer (30 s when signed in, 5 s when signed out or unavailable, 10 s when Hister's user handling is
off). The order of checks, first match decides:

1. a Hister token; present but invalid is a 401, never passed over;
2. a session id, from Bearer mhs_… or the machiya_sso cookie;
3. no credential: a page is sent to the helper's sign-in (at most once per 30 s per browser: the loop guard), an API
   call gets 401 JSON {"error": "sign in", "signin": …}; unless sign-in is known to be unavailable, then 4.;
   with MACHIYA_SIGNIN_PROVIDER (v0.21, e.g. `oidc`: Tailscale's tsidp, which knows the device) the address carries
   provider=<it>&auto=1, so the helper goes straight through that provider with no page and no tap (an installed web app
   has its own cookie jar and would otherwise ask once per app); the helper shows its page instead after a
   deliberate sign-out (the `<sign-in cookie>_out` marker, which signout() sets) or a failed round trip, and the
   loop guard's page links to the plain sign-in page;
4. unavailable (the helper or Hister unreachable, a 5xx, or user handling off): with `<P>_AUTH_FALLBACK=tailscale` a
   Tailscale-User-Login in `<P>_USERS` is admitted as the owner, with a banner and nothing cached; with `none` (Kura)
   the answer is 503.

"Signed out" (the helper's 401) never falls back: only "nobody answered" does. A Hister username outside
`<P>_HISTER_USERS` is a 403 (OAuth creates other accounts on its own), never a fallback and never a redirect.

Room sessions (v0.22, docs/identity.md "One cookie per room"): the room keeps its OWN host-only cookie,
`__Host-<sign-in cookie>_<room>` (`__Host-machiya_sso_kura`), holding a room session `mhr_…` that only this room's
origin may use. A browser without one is sent to the helper with `state=<SHA-256 of a nonce>` (the nonce stays in the
host-only cookie `…_state`); the helper, once it knows the browser, sends it back to `/machiya/callback?code=mhc_…`,
which `resolve` answers itself: it trades the code at the helper's internal `POST /v1/redeem` (one use, 60 s, bound
to this room's origin and to the nonce) for the room session and redirects to the page. Every check names this room
(`X-Machiya-Room: <origin>`, plus `<P>_AUTH_ACCEPT_ORIGINS`), so a room session copied to another room is refused.
Headless callers present a room token (`Bearer mht_…`) the helper issued for this room; Shiori's apps keep their
`Bearer mhs_…`. The old shared-domain cookie (`machiya_sso`) and Hister's raw token are still read, after the room's
own cookie, and passed to the helper, which accepts them only while its HISTER_LOGIN_LEGACY says so.

Preferences (v0.21, docs/contracts/prefs.md): in this mode a room's `/api/prefs` is the account's. The room calls
`forward_prefs`, which passes the request to the helper's `GET`/`PUT /v1/prefs` with the CALLER's own credential
(never a user id), so a container on the internal network can't read or write anyone else's settings. The check's
answer also carries the account's shared preferences (`Result.prefs`) for a fresh browser's first render.

Standard library only; nothing here is specific to one room. The helper shares `safe_return` and `hister_headers`.
