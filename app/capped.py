"""A cap on a listener's concurrent connections, and a limit on how long one may last.

Every listener (web, gemini, gopher) starts a thread per connection. A client that opens many connections, or holds
one open by sending a byte at a time, would otherwise keep them all. With this mixin a connection over the cap is
closed at once (a client sees a reset and tries again later), and a connection that is still open after `lifetime`
seconds is shut down. Put it before the server class: `class Server(Capped, ThreadingHTTPServer)`."""
